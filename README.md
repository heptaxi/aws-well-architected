## What you should aim for first

Keep in mind that access should only be given explicitly and that least privilege principal is core to a secure environment. This basic idea helps reduce the attack surface, and makes it easier to reason about the system.

- IAM
- automation/reproducability
- detection
- prepare for incidents

## Example Exercices
- RunBook
- PlayBook
- GameDays

## Security Design Principles
- strong identity Foundation
- traceability
- security at all layers
- automate/enforce security best practices
- protect data at rest and in transit
- keep people away from data

### Networking
The most important advice is to only give access if necessary
